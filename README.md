## Introduction - Weather Events Impact Analysis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This brief study involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

## Focus Area and Questions
The basic goal of this study is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events and their impact on fatalities, injuries, and the economy.

##### 1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

##### 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

This report may be considered by a government or municipal manager who might be responsible for preparing for severe weather events and will need to prioritize resources for different types of events.

## Data

The data for this assignment come in the form of a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size. You can download the file from the following web site:

* [Storm Data [47Mb]] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2)

There is also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find information on how the variables are constructed/defined.

* [National Climatic Data Center Storm Events FAQ] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records. More recent years should be considered more complete.

## Reproducible Research

The results of this study are published in the `StormImpactAnalysis.md` and `StormImpactAnalysis.html` files.

The results have also been published to RPubs. You may access it here [NOAA Storm Impact Analysis](http://rpubs.com/jrbattles/190200)
